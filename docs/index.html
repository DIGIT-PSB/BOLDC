<h1>The Behrend Open Lab for Digital Cinema</h1>
 <h2>at Penn State Erie, The Behrend College</h2>
<div>
<p>
Thanks to the Black familyâ€™s generosity, The School of Humanities and Social Sciences has established the Behrend Open Laboratory for Digital Cinema (BOLD Cinema). We view cinema as essential to exploring human experience and encouraging cinematic collaboration between Behrend and the local community.
</p>
<p>
Inviting the outside world into the classroom and bringing the classroom to the outside world defines the open lab experience. BOLD Cinema, therefore, encourages collaborations of Behrend students with local independent filmmakers, non-profit institutions, and commercial clients. We are eager to support boldly experimental projects of our students and community in Erie.
