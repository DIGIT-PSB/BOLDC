                <p class="policy"><b>This is professional-grade equipment, and should be treated as
                        such.</b> When working with the Bold-C staff and equipment, you are expected
                    to behave in a responsible and professional manner. We wish to give you the best
                    service possible and expect the same in return. Any production that uses BOLD-C
                    equipment should credit our organization.</p>

                <p class="policy"><b>Use of the Bold-C inventory of equipment is a privilege and
                        should be treated as such.</b> Respect for our rules, regulations, and
                    safety precautions should be followed at all times. The goal of Bold-C is to
                    bring industry-level equipment and experience to the students who seek it. In
                    order to be able to do this, each exchange with students needs to follow the set
                    rules, so that the next can enjoy and learn from the equipment without any
                    broken, damaged or missing pieces. Failure to follow these principles will
                    result in penalties including, but not limited to, loss of privileges.</p>

                <div>
                    <h4 class="policy">Basic Eligibility</h4>
                    <ul class="policyList">
                        <li>To be eligible for use of BOLD-C equipment, the student must maintain a
                            cumulative GPA of 2.5 or above </li>
                        <li>The student must be up-to-date on the training manuals and safety
                            precautions outlined in our <a href="safetyPolicy.html">Safety
                                Policy.</a>
                        </li>
                        <li> Projects that are eligible are those for academics, senior projects,
                            school use, club use and other projects that might get approved. </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h4>Training Requirements</h4>
                    <p>Along with these requirements students must meet some small
                        training requirements. Among these requirements are the following:</p>

                    <div class="indent"><h5><b>Training Resources:</b></h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Training demos </li>
                        <li>Equipment Workshops</li>
                        <li>Safety Documentation</li>
                        <li>Approval from committee for certain items.</li>
                    </ul></div>
                    <p>At a bare minimum level, we ask that the student take one workshop, keep up
                        with the operating manual of any item being used, and follow the safety
                        procedures outlined <a href="safetyPolicy.html">here</a>. Specifically, for
                        permission to use the RED Camera, the borrower will need a <b>minimum</b> of
                        20 minutes of training and operation of it. As mentioned earlier, some items
                        will need advisory committee approval for use, as well as safety
                        documentation.</p>
                </div>


                <div>
                    <h4>Check-Out Procedure</h4>
                    <p>When checking out BOLD-C Equipment, there are a number of
                        items required. Equipment will not be checked out without them. They are as
                        follows:</p>

                    <div class="indent">

                        <li>Reason for use of equipment

                                </ul>
                        </li>

                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
</div>

                    <p> Standard checkout will last a maximum of three days; however,
                        we understand that things may not go as planned. Requests for extensions can
                        be made, as long as they are formally made. Keeping the equipment without
                        consent can result in consequences. To make an extension simply send an
                        email to <a href="mailto:boldc@psu.edu?subject=BOLDC-inquiry&amp;"
                            >boldc@psu.edu</a> with the details of your checkout and the reason for
                        the extension. Some items are subject to differing rules, such as some
                        lighting items and some cameras. The borrower will be briefed on these items
                        when submitting a request to borrow them.</p>
                </div>

                <div>

                <div>
                    <h4>Reservations</h4>
                    <p>Reservations for equipment can be made <a href="proposal.html">here</a>. In
                        order to make a reservation, there are a number of things the requester must
                        know to make said reservation. Among these are the following:</p>
                    <div class="indent"><ul>
                        <li>The dates needed</li>
                        <li> Name of individual who approved the project </li>
                        <li>Name of equipment needed </li>
                        <li>Duration of the reservation</li>
                    </ul></div>
                    <p>Reservation policy follows the same general rules and requirements as regular
                        checkouts. However, a reservation allows for scheduling and securing of
                        equipment for a set production time frame.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h4>Extensions</h4>
                    <p>Checkout will last the duration specified in the request form, however we
                        understand that things may not go as planned. Requests for extensions can be
                        made, as long as they are formally made. Keeping the equipment without
                        consent can result in consequences. Failure to extend a lease will result in
                        consequences up to and including loss of privileges.</p>
                </div>



                <div>
                    <h4>Equipment Return </h4>
                    <p>Return of equipment should be made at the set hours, but an appointment can
                        be set with a member of the BOLD-C team. Upon return of the item, a short
                        inception will be held to make sure the equipment is returned in the same
                        condition in which it was borrowed. Before return, a set of procedures must
                        be followed:</p>
                    <div class="indent"><ul>
                        <li>Empty any memory cards in the device </li>
                        <li>Return equipment in a fully-charged state </li>
                        <li>Report any issues with the equipment, if any</li>
                    </ul></div>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h4>Rescheduled Return dates</h4>
                    <p>When a return date is set up, you are expected to return equipment on that
                        day. First offense of failing to do so will result in a warning. Second
                        offense a temporary suspension. Finally a third a forfeit of all BOLD-C
                        privileges. </p>
                </div>


                <div>
                    <h4>Malfunctioning Equipment </h4>
                    <p>In the event of malfunctioning equipment, please record exactly what
                        occurred, and under what conditions it happened. This is crucial information
                        for understanding how an issue arose so that it may be resolved. </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h4>Use of Content</h4>
                    <p>Any content created using BOLD-C gear, or with a member of the BOLD-C team
                        can be used as promotional material for the BOLD-C Program. This use can be
                        but is not limited to web content, social media marketing, and digital
                        signage. </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h4>Negligence</h4>
                    <p>When the student has possession of an item checked out, that student, alone,
                        is responsible for it. At BOLD-C, we strive to create an environment of
                        creativity and innovation. This environment cannot thrive if these rules are
                        not followed. We hope to empower students to create the project of their
                        dreams, but only if that does not inhibit the dreams of others. We ask the
                        recipients to, please, keep these rules in mind when handling BOLD-C
                        equipment.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h4>Security and Storage </h4>
                    <p>Items need to be stored in a secure location. Areas in a house with doors
                        that can be locked are best. Cars are not an acceptable secure location. If
                        a safe spot can not be provided, items can be brought back to campus.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h4>Insurance </h4>
                    <p>The need for insurance may be applicable for some shoots. Items that are
                        borrowed in bulk, where you may have a camera with all its accessories, and
                        light kits. Times where only one item is lent, this will not be
                        necessary.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h4>Projects outside of Behrend </h4>
                    <p>If you are from outside the Behrend community and borrowing equipment,
                        students from the Behrend populace must be involved in some way. Members of
                        the BOLD-C project must be allowed on set at any time.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Publicity and Credit</h4>
